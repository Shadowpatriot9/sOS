Description:
sOS is a operating system built from scratch in a way to act as a more in depth learning project to C++. The OS will be as basic as you can get until it has reached a point where it is completed as a solid start and can be added down the line w/further services, desktop, startup applications, extensive features on core or subs, etc... The approach can be influenced by that of a core of a general linux distro (debian based) and the fluidity of a macOS and if able to be able to emualte a more x86 chipset for similar windows applications but this is a lesser priority.

Core:
- Boot Sequence (no GRUB)
- OS Architecture (32-bit)
- Assembly to C
- Screen output and keyboard input
- Kernel

Sub:
- Shell (CLI only)
- File System (single root folder)
- User Mgmt (one main root user)
- basic libc (small, setup for larger)
- text editor
- One system service interacting w/hardware (networking) and to be built w/improvements to be added in the future
